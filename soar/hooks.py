""" Functions for brains to hook into various elements of Soar.

To make use of a given hook, a brain should import it from here. It will be redefined by the client or controller
accordingly.

Treat all hook names as reserved words, and do not use them as arbitrary variable names.

    Set by the client when the brain module is loaded.

    Brains that import this hook can expect that their methods will always run in the main thread when running in GUI
    mode, as Tkinter is not thread-safe. Otherwise, this is not guaranteed.

    Args:
        window: The Tkinter window to attach to Soar. This may also be some object that supports a `destroy()` method.
        linked (bool): If `True`, the window will be destroyed whenever the controller reloads.

    Returns:
        The window or object that was attached.
