"""  Tkinter wrapper for plotting using matplotlib_

.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org

Note:
    Unlike use of the :func:`soar.hooks.tkinter_hook`, use of this module will not force brain methods to run on the
    main thread alongside Soar's GUI event loop.

    However, methods of `PlotWindow` *will* run on the main thread, regardless of what thread the other brain methods
    run in.

    `PlotWindow` is wrapped by the client to ensure that the proper mode (GUI or headless) is enforced regardless
    of the arguments passed to the constructor by the brain methods.

    The client will also ensure that, if logging is occurring, any `PlotWindow` objects will have their image data
    included in the log whenever the controller is shut down.

Based on code written by Adam Hartz, August 1st 2012.
